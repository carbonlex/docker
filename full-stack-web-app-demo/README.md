I wrote a five-part in-depth tutorial series on building a modern, full-stack web application using Spring Boot, server-side rendered VueJS, Docker, Heroku and Gitlab CI/CD. Let me elaborate:

You have an idea, you want to build a slick, modern application. So you start working. But what setup makes sense? How do you get a database connected to your backend again? All the sudden, you find yourself going through countless frameworks and documentation. At this point, the big spark of energy you had starts to faint and you lose interest. As it happened to me again recently, I decided to build myself a modern setup for a full stack web application. While I was programming it, I realised that I sometimes tend to fool myself that I have understood something without fully understanding it. To force myself to understand everything fully, I wrote a tutorial series about it. In five parts, I'll take you through the process of building a modern web application using Java with Spring Boot, Javascript with Vue and NuxtJS, Docker, Heroku, Gitlab CI/CD.
